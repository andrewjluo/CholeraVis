This "trend chart" shows loading times across releases of a hypothetical web application.

It is a mixture of a line chart and an area chart, with the daily median loading time indicated by the line and percentile ranges indicated by the surrounding areas.

The "lollipops" mark releases of (different parts of) the application.
